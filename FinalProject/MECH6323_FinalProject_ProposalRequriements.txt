Final Project in lieu of Final Exam Please start thinking about your final project. 
Your project should use the techniques and tools covered in this course on a particular physical system.
This may or may not be related to your research. 
In the project, you can use analysis tools to assess the robustness of a given feedback system. 
Alternatively, you can use optimal control techniques (LQR, H1, H2) to synthesize a controller. 
For now, please specify the system that you will consider.
Give a brief 1-page summary describing the physical system that you will study. 
This should include a description of the (linearized) dynamics as well as some initial simulation results (e.g., open-loop step response if the system is stable). 
You may work individually or in a group of two. 
Just make sure you mention the names of both group members on the summary. 
Deadline: Please email me your 1-page project summaries before the beginning of class on April 6th.
